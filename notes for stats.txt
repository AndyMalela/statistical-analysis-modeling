rate = lambda

scale = 1/lambda = theta = alpha

*larger scale/theta = distribution is stretched
shape/skew = k = alpha

poisson generates a exponential dist of inter arrival times (alpha=1)
whatever you lambda is, 1/lambda is your scale (is that our mean?)

we can use the idea of poisson process generating a alpha 1 gamma dist inter-arrival times, 

you generate random inter-arrival times with specific scale. we do this 2000 times. for each one, generate more than 100 numbers but have each times have the same amount. i.e. 2000 samples of 150 numbers.

The Poisson process and Gamma distribution are intimately related through the fundamental property that the inter-arrival times in a Poisson process with rate λ are exponentially distributed with parameter λ, and the sum of k independent exponential random variables follows a Gamma distribution with shape parameter k and scale parameter 1/λ. Specifically, if N(t) denotes the counting process of a Poisson process with intensity λ, then the time T_k until the k-th event occurs follows a Gamma distribution with shape α = k and scale β = 1/λ. In our implementation, we generated Gamma-distributed samples with shape α = 2.0 and scale β = 1.5, which corresponds to the waiting time for the 2nd event in a Poisson process with rate λ = 1/1.5 ≈ 0.667 events per unit time. The MLE results demonstrate this relationship: the estimates of α and β converge around their true values with a standard deviation that decreases with sample size, confirming both the theoretical properties of the Gamma distribution and validating the consistency of maximum likelihood estimation. The narrow, bell-shaped histograms centered near the true parameters (α ≈ 2.0 and β ≈ 1.5) illustrate that the MLEs are asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed—properties that emerge directly from the underlying Poisson process structure, where each Gamma sample represents aggregated inter-arrival times from the stochastic point process. This connection highlights how the Gamma distribution naturally characterizes cumulative waiting times in Poisson processes, making it essential for modeling and analyzing arrival phenomena in queueing theory, reliability engineering, and other applications involving temporal randomness.
